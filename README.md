# Payment Integration with Stripe - Spring Boot Java

This project demonstrates how to integrate Stripe, a popular payment processing platform, into a Spring Boot Java application. By following this guide, you will be able to accept payments securely and efficiently using Stripe's powerful API.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that you have the following:

- JDK (Java Development Kit) installed on your machine
- Apache Maven for building and managing dependencies
- Stripe account and API keys (test or live depending on your development stage)
- IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for Java development (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Spring Tool Suite)

## Setup and Configuration

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
3. Configure your Stripe API keys:
   - Open `application.properties` file located in the `src/main/resources` directory.
   - Replace `YOUR_STRIPE_API_KEY` with your own Stripe API key.
   - Optionally, update other configuration parameters as needed (e.g., currency, webhook endpoints).
4. Save the changes to the `application.properties` file.

## Building and Running the Application

To build and run the Spring Boot application:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project's root directory.
3. Run the following command to build the application:
   ```
   mvn clean install
   ```
4. Once the build is successful, run the following command to start the application:
   ```
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
5. The application will start on the configured port (default: 8080).
6. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:8080` or the specified port.

## Testing the Payment Integration

To test the payment integration with Stripe:

1. Ensure that the application is running.
2. Visit the home page (`http://localhost:8080`).
3. Follow the provided instructions to initiate a test payment.
4. Use the provided test credit card details (e.g., `4242 4242 4242 4242`, any future expiration date, any 3-digit CVC) to simulate a successful payment.
5. Upon successful payment, a confirmation message will be displayed.
6. Optionally, explore the source code to understand how the integration with Stripe is implemented.
